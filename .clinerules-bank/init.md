I am planning a project to create a simple researcher multi-agent system using Pydantic-AI. It must follow the evaluator-optimizer workflow, where agent A generates a response following a user research question while  agent B provides evaluation and feedback to agent A in a loop. The loop continues until the agent B accepts the improved response. The loop has also a limit to avoid an infinity loop. Agent A can also use a Brave Search MCP or Tavily Search MCP tools to gather further knowledge.  I need your help with the high level direction and initial tasks. First, use the Brave API MCP to search for evaluator-optimizer workflow and pydantic-ai and learn more about them. Then, create a PLANNING.md and TASK.md files: 

PLANNING.md - high level direction, scope, tech, etc. 
TASK.md - initial tasks to knock out for the project

Do not code anything else. Only create these initial markdown files.
