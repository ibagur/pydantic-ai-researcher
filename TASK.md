# Project Implementation Tasks

## 1. Setup and Configuration
- [x] Create initial project structure
- [ ] Set up local environment variables for API authentication

## 2. Define Core Data Models
- [x] Create Pydantic models for research queries
- [x] Define response structure models
- [x] Implement feedback and evaluation criteria models
- [x] Design iteration tracking and control structures

## 3. Implement Agent A (Researcher/Optimizer)
- [x] Define the system prompt for Agent A
- [ ] Implement integration with Brave Search MCP
- [x] Create response generation logic
- [x] Develop response optimization mechanisms that incorporate feedback
- [x] Add structured output validation

## 4. Implement Agent B (Evaluator)
- [x] Define the system prompt for Agent B
- [x] Design evaluation rubrics and criteria
- [x] Create structured feedback generation logic
- [x] Implement acceptance decision mechanism
- [x] Add iteration limit enforcement

## 5. Develop Workflow Orchestration
- [x] Create the main loop controller
- [x] Implement agent interaction flow
- [x] Add loop termination conditions (acceptance or max iterations)
- [x] Develop response tracking and versioning

## 6. Implement Search Tool Integration
- [ ] Create wrapper for Brave Search MCP
- [x] (Optional) Implement Tavily Search integration
- [x] Add search result formatting and filtering
- [ ] Implement citation and source tracking

## 7. Documentation and Refactoring
